# BSNL Broadband Auto Reconnect
Hi fellow BSNL Broadband user, I know you are in great pain of dialing the broadband connection everytime your connection drops.

Well, **NOT ANYMORE!**

## Requirements
- [Python 3.5+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Currently only for windows machines.

## Installation
Just update the `autodial.bat` to have your `username` and `password`.

Also, make sure your connection name is correct. Default name is `"Broadband Connection"`.

## Contributing
Feel free to branch out and make pull requests. I would highly appreciate if you report any bugs or code-breaks.
